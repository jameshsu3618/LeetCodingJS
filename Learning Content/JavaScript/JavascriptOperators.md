JavaScript Operators
Operators in JavaScript are symbols that are used to perform operations on operands. Below is an overview of various types of operators in JavaScript and their functionalities.

JavaScript Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between numeric operands.

+: Addition
-: Subtraction
*: Multiplication
/: Division
%: Modulus (Division Remainder)
++: Increment
--: Decrement
**: Exponentiation
JavaScript Assignment Operators
Assignment operators are used to assign values to JavaScript variables.

=: Assign
+=: Add and assign
-=: Subtract and assign
*=: Multiply and assign
/=: Divide and assign
%=: Modulus and assign
**=: Exponentiation and assign
JavaScript Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values.

==: Equal to
===: Strict equal to (value and type)
!=: Not equal
!==: Strict not equal (value and type)
>: Greater than
<: Less than
>=: Greater than or equal to
<=: Less than or equal to
JavaScript Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

&&: Logical AND
||: Logical OR
!: Logical NOT
JavaScript Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on binary representations of numbers.

&: AND
|: OR
^: XOR
~: NOT
<<: Left shift
>>: Right shift
>>>: Unsigned right shift
JavaScript Ternary Operator (Conditional Operator)
The ternary operator is a shorthand for the if-else statement, used to assign a value based on a condition.

condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse
JavaScript Comma Operator
The comma operator allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in a single statement and returns the result of the last expression.

JavaScript Unary Operators
Unary operators are operators with only one operand.

+: Unary plus, attempts to convert an operand to a number
-: Unary negation, negates its operand
typeof: Returns a string indicating the type of the unevaluated operand
void: Discards a return value
delete: Deletes an object's property
JavaScript Relational Operators
Relational operators are used to test for a specific relationship between two entities.

in: Returns true if a specified property is in a specified object
instanceof: Returns true if a specified object is an instance of a specified object
JavaScript BigInt Operators
BigInt is a built-in object that provides a way to represent whole numbers larger than 2^53 - 1, which is the largest number JavaScript can reliably represent with the Number primitive.

BigInt operators are similar to Number operators, but they work with BigInt numbers.
JavaScript String Operators
The + operator is also used to concatenate strings.

+: Concatenates two string values, producing another string that combines the operand strings.
